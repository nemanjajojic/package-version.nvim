## 📦 Installation

Install plugin using package manager of your choice, for example with

### lazy.nvim

```lua
{
    "nemanjajojic/package-version.nvim",
    config = function()
      require("package-version").setup()
    end,
    keys = {
        -- Here you can set your preferred keybinding eg.
        { 
            "<leader>C",
            ":ComposerPackageVersion<CR>",
            mode = "n", 
            desc = "Show installed composer package version" 
        },
,
    }

}
```

## 💻 Commands

In order to execute command you have to type

```vim
:ComposerPackageVersion
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It's important to note that this command can be executed only
> when `composer.json` is open in current buffer.

## ⌨️ Mappings

Plugin do not have any default mapping configured for command.
You can choose your own keybinding.

## 💡 Idea

An idea is to simplify the workflow for developers who frequently work with
PHP projects by providing immediate visibility of installed package versions directly
within the `composer.json` file.

Apart from enhancing productivity, this feature aims to reduce
context switching between files.

> [!NOTE] :W
> This plugin draws inspiration from JetBrains PhpStorm IDE’s feature
> that displays installed package versions when the `composer.json` file is open.

## ✨ Next Steps

Plan is to support more package managers in the future:

- npm
- pip
